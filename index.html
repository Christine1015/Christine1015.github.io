        <h2 id="name">Name of BTS</h2>
        <p>The group's name, BTS, stands for the Korean expression Bangtan Sonyeondan, literally meaning "Bulletproof Boy Scouts". 
            The name was conceptualized with the thought that BTS would block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that target adolescents like bullets and protect the values and ideals of today’s adolescents.
            In Japan, they are known as Bōdan Shōnendan, which translates similarly.
            In July 2017, BTS announced that in addition to Bangtan Sonyeondan or Bulletproof Boy Scouts, the name would also stand for "Beyond The Scene" as part of their new brand identity.
            This extended their name to mean "growing youth BTS who is going beyond the realities they are facing, and going forward.</p>
